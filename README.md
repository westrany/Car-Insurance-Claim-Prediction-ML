# Car Insurance Claim Predictor ML  

## Business Understanding  

The task at hand consists in building a classifier for a car insurance company that predicts if a client will claim insurance or not, with the end goal being to develop an ML model that uses customer details as input and outputs binary predictions of whether customers will make insurance claims or not.  

The data provided in the dataset_prepared.csv file consists of 1000 records of customer information from the car insurance company. The data set includes the following relevant attributes: gender, age, race, driving experience, education, income, credit score, vehicle details, marital status, number of children, country, post code, annual mileage, vehicle type, speeding violations, driving under influence, and past accidents. The target variable is HAS_CLAIMED_INSURANCE which indicates if a customer has claimed insurance or not.  

The finished system will require a classifier model capable of predicting whether or not a customer will claim insurance based on the attributes listed above. The system will take into consideration customer details (input) and will produce a binary prediction (output) of “claim” (1) or “no claim” (0). 

This task suits the requirements of a Data Mining Approach due to: its large dataset which provides a substantial amount of data to extract patterns and insights; its complex relationships in insurance claiming decisions which tend to depend of factors such as customer demographics, driving history, and policy details, which are analysed through data mining techniques, thus finding patterns that are hard to find and discern manually; its classification problem since predicting whether or not a customer will claim insure is a classification problem, and a common application of data mining techniques; and its decision support to develop an accurate classifier which will help the car insurance company to assess risks, optimize premiums, and make informed decisions based on customer data.   

The following terminology can be found throughout the report:  

•	Attribute: also known as feature or variable, it is a specific characteristic or property of data. Within this report, attribute will refer to the various attributes of the csv file dataset which help describe and categorize the customers.  
•	Binary prediction: prediction or classification with two and only two outcomes or categories. Within this report, binary prediction will refer to the model’s prediction as to whether or not the customer will claim insurance. It will be represented as “1” for “claim” and “0” for “not claim”.
•	Input: independent variables/features. Within this report, input will refer to the customer attributes provided in the csv file to be used in the model for prediction.
•	ML Model (or simply Model): a mathematical representation of the relationships between input attributes and the target variable.
•	Output: prediction or result generated by a ML model. Within this report, output will refer to the binary prediction of whether or not a customer will claim insurance as represented by the variable “HAS_CLAIMED_INSURANCE”.
•	Predictive Model: similar to Model. It is a mathematical or statistical model that uses historical data and patterns to make inferences about future outcomes or events by identifying relationships and patterns in the input data and applying them to make predictions upon the output variable. 
•	Target variable: also known as dependent variable or response variable, it is the variable that will be predicted. Within this report, target variable will refer to the “HAS_CLAIMED_INSURANCE” column within the csv file which indicates whether or not a customer has claimed insurance.
•	Task: the task at hand, to build a classifier ML model that predicts whether or not a customer will claim insurance based on their attributes as listed in a csv file.
•	Variable: an attribute or feature of a dataset. E.g.: age, gender, country, …
o	Categorical: see Nominal.
o	Continuous: it refers to a numeric variable that can be any value within a given range. It can be fractional and/or decimal and it has an infinite number of possible values. E.g.: income, annual mileage …
o	Discrete: it refers to a numeric variable that can only take certain values or integers. E.g.: past accidents, speeding violations, …
o	Nominal: also known as Categorical, it represents categorised/labelled data without any inherent order or numeric value and is treated as labels that are later used to represent different groups/categories. It can have a finite number of distinct values. E.g.: gender, race, education, …
o	Numeric: it refers to data that is represented by numeric values, categorized into continuous and discrete variables. E.g.: credit score, speed violations, …
